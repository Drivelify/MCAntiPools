## ❓ » But... how is it possible?

> You see, we use different methods to prevent this...
- 🔧 ― Multi-pool system that spreads traffic across several connection pools for better performance.
- 🧠 ― Smart rate limiting adapts to server load and prioritizes important requests.
- 💾 ― Flexible caching with support for memory, Redis, or database backends.
- 📊 ― Live monitoring lets you track performance and receive instant alerts.
- 🛡️ ― Built-in protection handles retries and fallback gracefully to keep players online.
- 🌐 ― Cross-server caching lets multiple servers share the same cache seamlessly.
